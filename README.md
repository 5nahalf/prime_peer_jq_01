# jQuery Peer Challenge 1

In this Repo, you will find jQuery, a stub html file, and a script file with the 
random number function introduced last week. Your goal is to create a new Person object, that accepts a random
age 1-100, a random sex, and a random weight (for the purposes of this assignment, you can have a 100 pound 1 
year old).

Then, create a button, that when clicked, creates a new instance of the Person object, then appends that information
to your containers.

## Hard Mode
Refactor your code to have AGE, SEX, and WEIGHT in seperated containters. This can be tables or divs or however you 
would like to organize the content. The key being that the append functionality does not happen on one element.

## Pro Mode
Generate a random First and Last name for each of the people, according to their sex. Meaning that the name would
be pulled from either a 'female' or 'male' pool of names.
